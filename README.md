### __**Git architecture**__

In repertory [Problem-sets](./Problem-sets/) you will find my answer to problem sets of course

In repertory [src](./src/) you will find a complete and gamable sudoku game under test to practice what is learned

In reperctory [test](./test/) you will find a complete test strategy explaned in presentation 

<br />

### __**Run tests**__

```console
foo@bar:~$/src/module >$(PYTHON) ./_test.py
foo@bar:~$ >
```

<br />

### __**Unsolved problem**__

I was unable to run the tests in the correct directory, so I made a copy of them in the [module](./src/module/) (where the functions to be tested are and everything works) and I will explain the strategy in the presentation. 

With a little more time I should be able to fix the problem.
